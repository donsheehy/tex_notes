\section{This is a test} % (fold)
\label{sec:this_is_a_test}

Some introductory prose including some math: $x = {n \choose 2}$.
There is also an equation environment:
\[
  e^x = \sum_{i=1}^\infty \frac{x^i}{i!}.
\]

This is a new paragraph. Here is a normal R.
The real numbers are denoted $\R$ and the plane is $\R^2$. Lots of mathbb R's $\R\R\R\R\R$.
Here is a different macro starting with R: $\RR$ that should fail because it is not defined.

And another new paragraph.
Next we give a theorem.  A true one.
Here is some \texttt{teletype text.}
Here is some \textbf{bold}, \emph{italic}, and \textsc{Small Caps}.


  \begin{theorem}\label{thm:true_theorem}
    It's true!  If $\vor_M(p) \subset ball(p,r)$ then party.
  \end{theorem}
  \begin{proof}
    I promise.
  \end{proof}

  The proof depends on this lemma.
  
  \begin{lemma}\label{lem:necessary}
    Something else that's true.
  \end{lemma}
